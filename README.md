# LaserSim
This is an old optics simulator I created with Unity when I was learning the laws of refraction and reflection in physics class.
It was originally to develop a physics-based character controller system, which I added a function for the player to grab interactable objects with a beam.
From there, I added an optics system that supports reflection and refraction (using Snell's law). Additionally, there were plans to create a digital logic system, but I never got to doing that.
